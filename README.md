# CS-300-Project-2

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

In this course, I learned about using algorithms for constructing code that could be used to storing, organizing, searching, adding and removing data. This type of code is an invaluable tool for streamlining what needs to be accomplished to create programs that can do a job in a concise and cost-saving manner. As with all fields or industries, time is money, and saving time and resources is key for the creation of a great product. For this assignment in particular, I was tasked with creating a program to sort and display data to a user, involving courses for ABCU University. 

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

Approaching this assignment, I was given a few choices for data structure algorithms, and decided to work with a binary search tree. I had originally chosen a vector structure, but decided to work with the binary search structure due to the user's ability to search in a timely manner, but also to the creator's ability to structure and iterate items in an organized manner. Vectors might be slightly faster, but the binary system allows for a more structured organization and also faster insertion and deletion, in the case of updating a library or database.  

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

Given that today there are endless resources available online (and great search algorithms help this be a reality!), as well as our given textbook resources, for most concepts it's easy to get information and guidance about particular problems. I did ultimately have trouble displaying the data properly in my program. I will look for feedback from my instructor and further research reasons why I had this issue, and will update the assignment afterward. 

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

This was the most complex program I have worked on so far. I was able to employ many tools within the code to solve particular problems, and that was a great experience. I am looking forward to being tasked with more complex assignments to further expand my skillset when it comes to algorithms. 

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

I feel that the amount of code structure syntax has increased greatly for what is needed to implement the structures I learned about in this course. This has further prompted me to be diligent about commenting, formatting, and using best practices for coding to enhance the maintainability, readability and adaptability of programs.
